## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't appear after loading

- Make sure you selected the `dist` folder, not the parent folder
- Check that Developer mode is enabled
- Try refreshing the extensions page

### Score overlay doesn't show on x.com

1. Make sure you're on `x.com` or `twitter.com`
2. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
3. Check if the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
4. Open DevTools (F12) → Console and look for `[X Algorithm Score]` messages

### "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"

- You may have selected the wrong folder
- Make sure you're selecting the `dist` folder that contains `manifest.json`
- Verify the zip was fully extracted

### Extension icon is missing from toolbar

1. Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome's toolbar
2. Find "X Algorithm Score" in the list
3. Click the pin icon to add it to the toolbar

### Score seems incorrect

The scoring is based on publicly available algorithm information and may not perfectly match X's actual ranking. Factors considered:

- Tweet length (optimal: 120-240 characters)
- Media presence (images, videos boost score)
- Questions (encourage replies)
- External links (penalized, especially for non-Premium)
- Hashtags (>2 triggers spam detection)
- Mentions (>3 looks spammy)

### AI Analysis not working

1. Make sure you've added your Claude API key in Settings
2. Check that the API key is valid at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
3. Ensure you have API credits available
